First I loaded the movies from movies.txt and showed movies by title or genre where first
I created a method genre_search exactly like the title_Search so that I could add a case
'show' in the other file.

I also added some cases including delete, seen,beenseen(shows already seen movies) and
notseen(shows unseen movies) where in such way it can mark a movie as seen,
List movies depending on whether they have been seen and delete a movie.



I also added a show_seen and show_unseen method such that it can work where I copied
like the method mark_as_Seen however for show_unseen I just changed the value to False
so that it gives the opposite of seen which is unseen.

 I made sure in the second file to load the movies first so that it can run the commands.
 Most importantly at the end, I closed the function so that it runs well.

Also If I want to make sure my methods run:


 a = Movies('my_list')
  a.load() 
  a.show()
  
   a.delete(3) 
  a.mark_as_seen(2) 
  a.show_seen() 
  a.show_unseen
  a.close()  
 

Everything runs perfectly as planned!
