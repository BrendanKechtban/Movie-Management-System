# Movies database class
#
# Written by Craig Miller, October 2021
# Updated February 2023
#
# Requires movies.txt file, which was adapted from
#    https://www.timeout.com/newyork/movies/best-movies-of-all-time
#
# Example usage:
#   mdb = Movies('my_list')
#   mdb.load() --- erases database and reloads from the text file movies.txt
#   mdb.show()
#   matches = mdb.title_search('jaws')
#   print(f'We found {len(matches)}!')
#
#   mdb.delete(3)  --- delete record number 3
#   mdb.mark_as_seen(2) --- indicate that movie 2 has been seen
#   mdb.show_seen() --- show all movies that have been seen
#
#   mdb.close()  --- close the connection
